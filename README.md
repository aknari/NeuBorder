## Contributing:
NeuBorder is full of holes. The theme barely works on mobile, it looks terrible in dark mode, and it doesn't look nearly as good as a properly implemented neumorphic design [should look](https://dribbble.com/tags/neumorphism).

If you want these things fixed, beg [sq1000000](https://github.com/sq1000000) to fix them in [issues](https://github.com/sq1000000/NeuBorder/issues), or  fix them yourself with a [pull request](https://github.com/sq1000000/NeuBorder/pulls).
