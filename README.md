## Contributing:
It's no secret that NeuBorder is full of holes

- The theme barely works on mobile
- It looks terrible in dark mode
- It doesn't look nearly as good as a properly implemented neumorphic design [should look](https://dribbble.com/tags/neumorphism)
- The thumbnail doesn't represent the look of the theme very well

If you want these things fixed, fix them yourself with a [pull request](https://github.com/sq1000000/NeuBorder/pulls), or beg [sq1000000](https://github.com/sq1000000) to fix them in [issues](https://github.com/sq1000000/NeuBorder/issues).

- [Nichtigott](https://github.com/Nichtigott) for the [theme](https://github.com/Nichtigott/obsidian-neumorphism) that I originally took a bunch of code from
